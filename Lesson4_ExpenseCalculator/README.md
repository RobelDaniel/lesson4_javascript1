### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I wasn't too familiar with the parse float function, but now I know what is for. It's basically a string that represents the value that you want to use.)
2. (I learned about the get element id function which is used to access the value that the user types in.)
3. (I learned about the clear form function which is a nifty little command. It resets the values the user types in, so that a new sequene of numbers can be entered.)
